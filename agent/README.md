# maid Agent package

Custom agent used to test the frontend & inspection package.

Composed of `loop.ts` (the core agent loop logic), `index.ts` where the api routes resides, `context.ts` is about context management functions and `/tools` where the tools resides (used to interact with external sources like filesystem, DBs, APIs and so on).
